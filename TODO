TODO

 - groups are now basic (unix like). Not possible to put a group in another
 like before. To do that, we must think about how to do a DAG in a database.
 Would be better to go back to a model where group and user are the same ...
 See Drupal?
 - I removed all that depends on the module Services for now Vincent 2008/04/15
(dynamic creation of services)
 - pas clair la distinction entre forum et forum_sql, user et usr_sql,
 notamment pour l'abstraction des types forum, group, user...
 - uniformize labels (put labels everywhere, and always the same name for the
 same type)
 - Remove parent parameter for all classes
 - Give up with ocamlduce? (for ex pb with empty <select> written <select />
 not displayed correctly by firefox ...)
 - Take care of exception (database ...) more carefully and write error messages
 - Faut tout revoir pour uniformiser. C'est vraiment le bordel.


Wiki:
 - What if two users modify the same page at the same time?

Users:
 - encryption of password for the db
 - using PAM or LDAP for authentication

Session manager:
 - clean everything
 - what is it? How does it work? Can we modularize?
 - probably use a functor instead of the class?
 - how to make is extensible? Do we want that?

Problems due to Postgresql:
 - Errors are just strings => only one exception
 - very difficult to abstract types (like Users.group)
 because the db returns int32

Wikisyntax:
 - extensible?
 - AST interpreter must be configurable (for ex if we want to forbid images in
 forum messages, or some kind of boxes (wikibox in forum message...))

TODO

 - groups are now basic (unix like). Not possible to put a group in another
 like before. To do that, we must think about how to do a DAG in a database
 - I removed all that depends on the module Services for now Vincent 2008/04/15
(dynamic creation of services)
 - pas clair la distinction entre forum et forum_sql, user et usr_sql,
 notamment pour l'abstraction des types forum, group, user...
 - uniformize labels (put labels everywhere, and always the same name for the
 same type)

Wiki:
 - What if two users modify the same page at the same time?

Users:
 - encryption of password for the db
 - using PAM or LDAP for authentication

TODO

 - groups are now basic (unix like). Not possible to put a group in another
 like before. To do that, we must think about how to do a DAG in a database.
 Would be better to go back to a model where group and user are the same ...
 See Drupal?
 - I removed all that depends on module Services for now Vincent 2008/04/15
(dynamic creation of services)
 - pas clair la distinction entre forum et forum_sql, user et usr_sql,
 notamment pour l'abstraction des types forum, group, user...
 - uniformize labels (put labels everywhere, and always the same name for the
 same type)
 - Give up with ocamlduce? (for ex pb with empty <select> written <select />
 not displayed correctly by firefox ...)
 - Take care of exception (database ...) more carefully and write error messages
 - Faut tout revoir pour uniformiser. C'est vraiment le bordel.
 - Not really clear where to use objects or functors. 
 Do we need overriding and late binding?
 - Uniformize the place where permissions are checked.
 Is it in the widgets? In the db interface?
 - Put sp in sd to avoid passing both parameters everywhere?
 Warning: sd is transmitted by actions to subsequent services, but sp must not!
 - Pourquoi les constructeurs des types "role" de forum ont des valeurs ?

How to make sure that:
 - user information is taken only once, for example role in the wiki, 
 in the forum and only if needed (lazy?)? And even if it is after an action.
 - all widgets have a ?classe parameter?
 - all database errors are taken into account?
 Wrap all db result in a kind of exception monad?
 - admin has all rights (just put admin in all groups by default?
 of make the function in_group answer yes? or check if the user is admin
 evrywhere? or all together?)

Wiki:
 - What if two users modify the same page at the same time?

Users:
 - encryption of password for the db
 - using PAM or LDAP for authentication

User widgets:
 - clean everything
 - Use a class model closer to wiki and remove Widget.ml?

Session manager:
 - clean everything
 - what is it? How does it work? Can we modularize?
 - probably use a functor instead of the class?
 - how to make is extensible? Do we want that?

Problems due to Postgresql:
 - Errors are just strings => only one exception
 - very difficult to abstract types (like Users.group)
 because the db returns int32

Wikisyntax:
 - extensible?
 - AST interpreter must be configurable (for ex if we want to forbid images in
 forum messages, or some kind of boxes (wikibox in forum message...))

Forum:
 - clean everything
 - type role is in forum_sql.ml whereas in wiki.ml
 Can we put it in forum.ml
 - Use a class model closer to wiki and remove Widget.ml?
 - Use Widget.widget_with_error_box

Ocsimore_lib:
 - De quoi on se sert ?
 - interface

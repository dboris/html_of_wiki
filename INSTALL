=== Requirements ===

* postgresql >= 8.2 (not for compiling)
* ocaml
* lwt >= 2.4.0
* eliom >= 2.2
* macaque
* ocaml-safepass >= 1.0 (or 1.0.1 on x86)
* ocamlpam (optional)
* ocamldap (optional)


=== Compilation ===

From the darcs repository, execute this first:

  $ oasis setup

Configure ocsimore (add --help to see all options):

  $ sh configure

Compile ocsimore:

  $ make

If you want system wide install, become root and install:

  $ sudo make install


=== Database setup (automatic) ===

Just run the init script with the postgres administrator:
- from the source directory:

  $ sudo -u postgres sh src/files/initdb.sh

- or after installation (can depend on your packages manager rules):

  $ sudo -u postgres sh /usr/share/ocsimore/initdb.sh

Note: If somting goes wrong, do the following common part, and retry.


=== Database setup (common part) ===

Adapt /etc/postgresql/.../pg_hba.conf to give ident access
for user ocsimore by copying the following line at the right place
(usually before the "local all all ident sameuser" line):

  local ocsimore ocsimore password

Restart postgresql, for example:

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart


=== Database setup (manual) ===

Create a postgresql user with that name (here 'ocsimore').
The new user needs no special role.

  $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P ocsimore

Create a database called ocsimore and add the language plpgsql

  $ sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF-8 -O ocsimore ocsimore
  $ createlang -U ocsimore plpgsql ocsimore

Then populate the database:

  $ psql -U ocsimore -f createdb.sql ocsimore

If something goes wrong, you can delete the database by typing:

  $ sudo -u postgres dropdb ocsimore


=== Configure ===

Adapt your /etc/ocsigenserver/ocsigenserver.conf with:
- from the source directory:

  local/etc/ocsigen/ocsimore.conf

- or after installation (can depend on your packages manager rules):

  /usr/share/ocsimore/ocsimore.conf


=== Run ===

Run Ocsigen, for example:
- from the source directory:

  $ make run

- or after installation:

  $ ocsigenserver

Note: Initially, as there is no wiki registered, you have to go to Ocsimore's
administration interface (by default on your site on path /ocsimoreadmin)
and create one.

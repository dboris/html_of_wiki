1. Requirements
 - postgresql >= 8.2 (even for compiling)
 - ocaml
 - ocamlduce
 - ocsigen and eliom with compiled ocamlduce support
 - pgocaml >= 1.2
 - ocamlpam

2. Run 

sh configure <password>

   where password is the password for database user ocsimore (see below).


3. Create a postgresql user with that name (here ocsimore).
The new user needs no special role.

sudo -u postgres createuser -P ocsimore

Adapt /etc/postgresql/.../pg_hba.conf to give Ident access
for user ocsimore by copying the following line at the right place
(usually before the "local all all ident sameuser" line):

 local ocsimore ocsimore password

Restart postgresql, for example:
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart


4. Create a database called ocsimore and add the language plpgsql

sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF-8 -O ocsimore ocsimore
createlang -U ocsimore plpgsql ocsimore

Then populate the database:
psql -U ocsimore -f createdb.sql ocsimore

If something goes wrong, you can delete the database by typing:
sudo -u postgres dropdb ocsimore


5. Install pgocaml with lwt support (lwt branch of cvs)
http://merjis.com/developers/pgocaml
Make sure to properly set DEFAULT_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKET_DIR in
pgocaml's Makefile.config, depending on your installation

6. Compile ocsimore
make

7. If you want system wide install:
 - Become root and install:
sudo make install
 - Adapt /etc/ocsimore.conf
 - Run Ocsigen, for example:
sudo ocsigen -c /etc/ocsimore.conf

8. To run ocsimore from the source directory:

CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=nis_chkpwd ocsigen -c ocsimore.conf.local
